Lab: Create Your Jedi Class
Objective:
In this lab, you will practice defining a Python class, creating objects, and writing methods. You will also explore GitHub by cloning a starter repository, creating a branch, and submitting your work via a pull request.

Instructions:
Clone the Starter Repository:
Open Visual Studio Code or your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to clone the project.
Run the following command to clone the starter repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ninjafiveo/Create-Your-Jedi-Class.git


Navigate into the cloned project folder:
bash
Copy code
cd Create-Your-Jedi-Class


Create a New Branch:
You will create a new branch to work on your Jedi class. Replace lastname_firstname with your actual name:
bash
Copy code
git checkout -b lastname_firstname


Define Your Jedi Class:
In the project, open or create a Python file named jedi_lastname_firstname.py (replace lastname_firstname with your name).
Define a Jedi class that includes at least the following attributes and methods:
Attributes: name, lightsaber_color, rank.
Methods:
A method to display the Jedi’s introduction (name, rank, lightsaber color).
A method that simulates a Force ability (e.g., Force push).
Example Code:
python
Copy code
class Jedi:
    def __init__(self, name, lightsaber_color, rank):
        self.name = name
        self.lightsaber_color = lightsaber_color
        self.rank = rank

    def introduce(self):
        print(f"I am {self.name}, a {self.rank} Jedi. My lightsaber is {self.lightsaber_color}.")

    def force_push(self):
        print(f"{self.name} uses Force Push!")

# Create a Jedi object
obiwan = Jedi("Obi-Wan Kenobi", "blue", "Master")
obiwan.introduce()
obiwan.force_push()


Create Objects from Your Class:
In your jedi_lastname_firstname.py file, create at least two different Jedi objects with different attributes (e.g., name, lightsaber color, and rank).
Call the introduce method and another method to display each Jedi’s abilities.
Stage, Commit, and Push Your Changes:
After completing your code, check the status of your changes:
bash
Copy code
git status


Stage your new file and any modified files:
bash
Copy code
git add jedi_lastname_firstname.py


Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Added Jedi class with methods for introduction and Force abilities"


Push your branch to the GitHub repository:
bash
Copy code
git push origin lastname_firstname


Create a Pull Request:
Go to the GitHub repository in your browser: https://github.com/ninjafiveo/Create-Your-Jedi-Class.
You should see an option to create a pull request for your branch. Click Compare & pull request.
Add a description of the changes you made and submit the pull request.
Submission:
Once your pull request is created, take a screenshot of your branch and pull request in GitHub.
Submit the screenshot and the pull request link via Google Classroom or your preferred platform.

Bonus Task (Optional):
Add another method to your Jedi class that simulates a lightsaber duel between two Jedi. This method could compare the ranks of the two Jedi and print out a winner.
